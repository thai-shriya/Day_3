Create a div which will display 5 todos initially with a pagination tab at bottom, when clicked on page 2 it shows next 5 todos, when clicked on page 3 it should fetch next 5 todos. Try to implement lazy loading using which you should load atleast 15 todos (3 pages) in advance. ( Use promises if possible). At a given time you will have three pages to be accessible, next and previous buttons will be available at the end and start.
